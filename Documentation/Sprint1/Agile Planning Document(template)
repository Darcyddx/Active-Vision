# Agile Planning Document

## 1. Sprint Goals

Clearly define the primary objectives of this sprint:

- Implement user authentication functionality.
- Enhance system performance.
- Address critical issues from user feedback.

## 2. Sprint Backlog

List structured and clear tasks associated with sprint goals:

| Task ID | Description                                                  | Assigned Member | Estimation (Hours/Points) | Deadline   | Status      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1       | Collect and label tennis player image datasets               | Kerry           | 5                         | 2025-03-20 | In Progress |
| 2       | Training court key point recognition model (preliminary version) | Lam Peiling     | 8                         | 2025-03-22 | Not Started |
| 3       | Develop a mobile interface prototype with model integration  | Michael         | 3                         | 2025-03-23 | Not Started |
|         |                                                              |                 |                           |            |             |
|         |                                                              |                 |                           |            |             |

## 3. Estimation and Velocity Tracking

Use agile estimation techniques (e.g., Story Points, hours) and track team velocity throughout the sprint. Document clearly for accurate future estimation.

- Example:
  - Estimated total effort: 30 Story Points
  - Current velocity (first 3 days): 4 Story Points/day

## 4. Tools and Management Methods

Clearly describe agile tools and methodologies used:

- **Agile Methods:** Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Reviews, Sprint Retrospectives
- **Management Tools:** GitHub Projects
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Communication:** Discord, WeChat

## 5. Risk and Issue Management

Clearly outline potential risks, their impacts, and mitigation strategies:

| Risk Description                                    | Potential Impact                                        | Mitigation Plan                                              | Owner             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Low accuracy of player recognition model**        | Users lose confidence, leading to poor app adoption.    | Early evaluation with different models; collect high-quality data to retrain frequently. | ML Engineer       |
| **Insufficient labeled dataset for training**       | Poor model performance and delays in project timelines. | Establish labeling pipeline; use external datasets; crowdsourcing to expedite labeling. | Data Engineer     |
| **Integration issues between frontend and backend** | Delayed release, lower app stability and reliability.   | Regular integration meetings, implement CI/CD for rapid issue identification and resolution. | Backend Developer |
| **Technology or framework incompatibility**         | Technical debt, rework, delayed timelines.              | Early technology stack validation; prototyping before major implementation decisions. | Technical Lead    |
| **Performance bottlenecks on mobile devices**       | Reduced user experience due to slow app performance.    | Regular performance testing; optimization strategies (e.g., lightweight models, inference optimization). | Mobile Developer  |

**Note:** Continuously update the documentation throughout the sprint to reflect progress accurately.
